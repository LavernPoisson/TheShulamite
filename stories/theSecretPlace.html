        <p> Psalms 91<br />
            He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
            <br /><br />

            The word dwell is to live, stay, inhabit, linger "He (You) who lives, stays, inhibits, lingers in the secret
            place,"<br /><br />

            What is this secret place?<br />
            The secret place is a place where you meet with God, in this place you silently whisper all your worries,
            cares and concerns,
            It is a place where you empty yourself, free yourself from every burden that is within you,
            It is a place where you leave your innermost pain and affliction down at the alter,
            It is a place created for you and I to have divine fellowship with our Father, He knows what we have need
            of.
            This place has been specially designed for us,
            God knew that at times it would be hard, life sometimes treats us unfair. That evil would sometimes seem to
            hard to bare.
            In this place there is knowing that God is with us.<br />
            You are not alone, that He is listening to your inward cry, those cries that no one ever sees that, no one
            ever hears. He listens in this place He created this place specifically for these reasons and so much more,
            <br /><br />

            In order to get to this place requires a moment of getting away from the noise away from the demands of
            life.
            To find this place requires a pulling away from the norms of life.
            Sometimes there is no other choice in finding this place, sometimes this place finds you.
            Sometimes the burdens and trials leave you no other choice, This place must find you, It looks for
            everyone...it is like a secret path, a mystery that in a moment, you get to choose to be found and when you
            do in that moment you close your eyes and go deep withing yourself and cry out to God, He waits, He listens,
            He sees...<br /><br />

            You shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<br /><br />

            I want you to take a moment and reflect, think about God's Shadow,
            think about being shadowed by a God that is so big, A God that has created all of the Heavens and all of the
            Earth and everything that is found in it including you and I.
            Think about His shadow that covers you and cools the temperament of life. A shadow brings shade in the heat
            of a day.
            A shadow gives direction, when a shadow falls you know which way the light comes from.<br /><br />

            When you are shadowed by someone you learn to become like them. You take on their good habits because in
            that moment of them shadowing you there is impartation.
            Think of a scholar getting shadowed by his teacher or when you in a place of learning when you shadowed by
            your peer, instructor, co worker there is a similarity in what you learn,
            The same applies in this instance when God shadows you...<br />
            Now imagine abiding under Gods shadow, to abide actually means that you live in God's guidance, His
            direction.
            You now live in the guidance of consistent Love .<br />
            God is Love, Gods Love engulfs you,
            you experience His Love under His shadow. His love guides you to safety, wards you away from evil, covers
            you, shelters you.
            His shadow is a sacred place of consistent divine protection and counsel.<br />
            His eyes go to and fro ensuring no harm come near your dwelling, He hides you in and protects you from all
            calamity and despair.<br /><br />

            The secret of staying in this place is to make a conscious desicion to continually share every part of
            yourself with Him, Then you walk in relationship with Him. Then you will never become bitter or broken or
            self righteous or religious because you have made an intentional desicion to give everything of yourself to
            Him, including the shame, the lies, the pain, the trauma.<br /><br />

            THEN YOU WILL SAY....
            "I will say of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."<br /><br />

            My prayer today is that you remember that God is with you wherever you go, that you remember to call on Him
            always in every situation call on Him and He will give you rest and He will abide in you as you abide in
            Him. God Bless the person that you want to receive this message, soften their hearts to agree with your
            Spirit, cause them to walk in your perfect plan for their life.<br /><br />
