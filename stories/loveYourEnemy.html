        <p>You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love
            your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully
            use you and persecute you,
            Matthew 5:43-44 NKJV<br /><br />

            It is easy to love those that love you back. Try loving those that don't deserve your love, don't deserve
            your time, don't deserve you.
            I have learned the meaning of this scripture and the impact of its power through many walks of life.
            When I prayed for those who despitefully used me I saw and experienced God in a very new and refreshing way.
            I would like to share this key with you today.<br /><br />

            When you begin to pray for those that use you, you give permission to a higher power to act on your behalf.
            You learn to recognise that there is need for God and in your own strength you cannot heal.<br /><br />

            When you pray for your enemy you render the enemy defeated, you dismantle the works of the enemy. You cause
            confusion in the enemies camp.<br /><br />

            You see he roams around seeking whom he may devour, your prayers will keep your heart from turning to stone
            toward others.
            You see your prayers causes a barrier of protection around your heart.
            You keep your heart as flesh and pliable in the hand of God.<br /><br />

            The word of God says we should guard our heart, as you pray you strengthen the walls of your heart.
            You deflect the hurt and pain through interceding for your enemy you allow yourself to heal.
            The process of healing is rapid because you have chosen not to be the victim.<br /><br />

            You receive victory in the situation that was designed to take you out.
            What was intended or used to take you out now works together for good...<br /><br />

            Your prayers have the power to bring salvation,your prayers have the power to bring deliverance and
            healing...Everything works together for good, it is two fold.<br /><br />

            You see God gives good gifts and weapons of warfare.
            He tells us to pray for our enemy because He knew that the ingredient of healing comes through prayer.
            Every command given from God no matter how foolish it may seem is to benefit you and I.<br /><br />

            It really does take the foolish things of this world to confound the wise, I encourage you to pray for those
            that have hurt you and watch how God uses it to turn things around.<br /><br />

            I pray the grace of God and His mercy be with you wherever you may go.<br /><br />
