        <p> Righteousness is the quality of being right in the eyes of God, including character (nature), conscience
            (attitude), conduct (action), and command (word)
            Psalms 34:17<br />
            THE RIGHTEOUS CRY, AND THE LORD HEARS and DELIVERS THEM OUT OF ALL TROUBLE.<br /><br />

            To be DELIVERED OUT OF ALL TROUBLE is not something that is temporary.<br />
            The word ALL is everything, total of something, the fullness or complete state. Everything before,
            everything after "All of it."<br />
            The word ALL screams eternity.<br />
            We should all desire to have eternal deliverance.<br /><br />

            "What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and yet lose his soul."<br />
            Yes, financial gain, prosperity, healing and peace whist living on earth is very beneficial and is attached
            to the blessing that God has for us however.<br />
            deliverance from eternal affliction, eternal pain, eternal damnation, eternal healing of body mind and soul.
            When your soul is delivered, you are set free from every bondage,
            you are ignited and ALL of you is made whole.<br /><br />

            The greater one that is inside of you and the power that is given is now activated.<br /><br />

            You step into ALL that you are, and you are able to change the course of life, not just for self but for
            many and by your association with others. This including neighbors, friends, family, work colleagues. This
            is truly what it means to be become the blessing.<br /><br />

            The land itself is preserved when the righteous cry out.<br /><br />

            Genesis 18 speaks of a time when a certain place in the bible called Sodom and Gomorrah was in such a bad
            state that God stood up to go and destroy the land.<br />
            Abraham being righteous and in right standing was in a position to stand in front of God and negotiate with
            Him, pleading and asking if there were at least righteous men in the land would God destroy the land?
            God answered and said no. There were no righteous men in the land so God eventually sent two angels to take
            out Abraham's nephew Lot before destroying it. The place was destroyed with fire and brimstone... The bible
            says that the world will be destroyed with fire and brimstone, I believe that God made an example of Sodom
            and Gomorrah. I believe the story is very applicable to today I believe that God is giving us a way out and
            showing us through this story our stance and how we can help preserve the land.<br /><br />

            God would have preserved the land if there were any righteous but there wasn't any.
            I encourage you to read that passage of scripture.<br /><br />
            .
            There are many places in different areas that have become like just Sodom and Gomorrah today, there is a
            definite stench of wickedness that is rising into the heavens and if the Righteous "which is you and I"
            don't take our rightful place and begin to cry out to God before it's too late, we give territory over to
            demonic influence and principalities of darkness in high places.<br /><br />

            When you see poverty, corruption, violence, all kinds of lusts, sickness, no fear of God and His teachings,
            spiritual blindness, lukewarm Christian, ungodliness in a place, drug addiction and alcohol abuse...<br />
            understand this the place is governed by rulers of darkness and when the evil becomes so great that it
            reaches the throne of God, then sudden destruction...<br /><br />

            I ask you this day to partner with the Holy Spirit, become the change you would like to see.<br /><br />

            Take your position, take your authority back.
            Repent, repent for the land and turn to Him take your rightful place once more, receive your garment of
            Righteousness become a willing participant and partner with Christ today... ETERNITY IS WAITING TO GIVE YOU
            ALL...<br /><br />
