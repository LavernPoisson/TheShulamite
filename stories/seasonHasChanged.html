        <p>Matthew 24:32<br />
            “From the fig tree learn its lesson:<br />
            as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. <br /><br />

            The tenderness of anything screams "Fragile, do not touch!" Liken yourself to the leaves of the fig tree,
            tender in emotion, sensitive, weary.<br />
            A long season can leave you feeling extremely tired from the elements of life. <br />
            "You literally start shedding off leaves before you can start putting out your leaves" It is a painful and
            misunderstood process. It is either make or break, the wind goes up a few notches.
            Have you ever watched as you coming out of a season, for example: Autumn is windy, August is the last month
            in Autumn and is usually the most windy month before you enter into spring.
            Such is life! It is always before the brink of a breakthrough that you find the heat or wind of a situation
            intensify. This can be related to any situation in family, marriage, work, etc.
            You start to shed off old habits, old friends, sometimes family, the tenderness and uncertainty of these
            situations make you feel a particular way, make you sometimes feel not needed, unwanted, unloved.
            You feel like you in a strange land all alone, you can be amongst others yet still feel all
            alone.<br /><br />

            It is called a place of transition, transitioning into your next, Into your next season.<br />
            The old season will teach you lessons,
            It is important to remember what you have been through.<br />
            You now have what it takes help others.<br /><br />

            The new season gives you hope and a deeper trust in God, He has walking with you in every season. He has
            never left your side.<br />
            You are now thankful, great full there is a new expectation,
            When the budding of the new season begins to enter you identify the errors of past, you get to walk in the
            newness of learning from your past, you have the opportunity to spread your tender leaves in this budding
            season of summer or spring.
            You are now equipt and ready to take on much more.<br />
            You can now sow into places and into others because your summer now becomes some one else's winter. <br />

            Psalms 74:17<br />
            It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.<br /><br />

            It is God who has made both summer and winter, It is God who set the boundaries, He knows how much you can
            handle.He will never give you more than you can bare.<br /><br />

            Store up in summer so that when winter comes again, you will be prepared for the season.<br />
            Store up the word of God in your heart, write it down on tablets,never let it depart from your heart.<br />
            Store up in worship so when winter comes again you can dig into your reserve well.<br />
            Store up in sowing seeds of Love ,Acts of service and generosity.<br />
            Give back to God, offer thanksgiving and offerings so that your store house never runs dry.<br />
            Make plenty time to spend with your Creator, He knows how to mold you and shape you once again, take care of
            yourself then those around you will enjoy the best of you.<br /><br />

            What's important to know is that there will always be seasons, make the most out of everything good or bad.
            If you learn nothing in a season you keep repeating it until you have learnt. So be quick to learn, be
            quicker to teach so that your winter wont last very long.<br /><br />
